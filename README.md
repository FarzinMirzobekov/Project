# 2D Game
A 2D Mario game. It was planned to be created using a self made simple game engine.
The project and knowledge were taken from a YouTUbe tutorial. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=025QFeZfeyM&t=11999s
The main library used is: LWJGL
Was created in IntelliJ IDEA
Due to it being unfinished, I do not know how to properly run it.
Shaders, Camera, and Window were tested.
I stopped in Textures part.
It was planned to create a code on which base other simple 2D games could be created.
Now the only features that were tested, lets it make a screen show similar to DVD screensaver.
However,those were tests, and during the proccess of adding the Textures, the test code was erased.
